# Odin Recipes

This repository showcases the first project I built using the Odin Project. It outlines my ability to use basic HTML to build a webpage that links to several other webpages.

## Description
This project is my first venture into web development. I have created a simple website that includes the recipes of three of my all-time favorite Indian recipes (I'm Indian), each having a detailed ingredient list and very helpfully laid out instructions. 

What it doesn't have is a photo of me enjoying all the three dishes because the first thing I do after stuffing myself with them is head straight to bed.

## Features
- Simple HTML structure
- Multiple recipe pages
- Links between pages
- Adding images in a page
- FUlfilling your ambitions to be on Masterchef at your home   ```

## Usage
Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the main page with links to various recipes. You can also just sneak into your nearest Indian restaurant's kitchen and hope they don't file charges against you.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes. Or if you want to send food to me, I'm open to that as well.
